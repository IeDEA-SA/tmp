# MATCHA

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of MATCHA is to provide an interface for producing data consistency reports.

## Installation

> **MATCHA requires R version 4.4.0 or higher.**
>
On Windows you may also need to install the corresponding version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to install the package from GitHub.

You can install the development version of MATCHA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IeDEA-SA/MATCHA")
```
Alternatively, you can use package `pak`

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("IeDEA-SA/MATCHA")
```


> NOTE: Because the repository is currently private, **installation will require that you have created a GitHub Personal Authorisation Token (PAT)** and made it available to the session (this is necessary for interacting through https with private repositories). 
>
> Follow the following instructions to:
> 
> - [create a GitHub PAT](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat#get-a-pat) 
> - [use the `credentials` ðŸ“¦ to store and make your PAT available](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat#credentials-package) to your R session. 
> 
> You can make your PAT available to any fresh R session by adding `credentials::set_github_pat()` to your `.Rprofile` file. This will run `credentials::set_github_pat()` at the start of each session, ensuring your PAT is available in the environment.
> To open your `.Rprofile` file for editing, run `usethis::edit_r_profile()`.


## Example

To run the app, load the library and run the `run_app()` function.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(MATCHA)
## basic example code
run_app()
```

## Select previous & current data

The first step involves selecting the directories containing the previous and current data to be compared.
The directories can be selected by clicking on the `Select a folder` button.

The file system navigator will open in the root of the demo data contained within the package. You can use this data to explore app functionality.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/select_directories_a.png")
```


### Select another root directory

To select another root directory, for example your home directory so you can navigate other folders on your system, click on the `demo_data` button in the top right corner of the file system navigator.

Selecting **home** will set the root to **your home directory** from where you can navigate to your own directories containing the previous and current data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/select_directories_b.png")
```


## Overriding default Primary Key source settings

Some plots require primary key information to be provided. By default, the app will attempt to infer the primary key from the data and store it centrally. It is configured to consider:

- a **table named `tblBAS` as the primary source** of primary key information.
- within the primary table, the **column `patient` to contain the actual primary key values**.

However, you can override this at runtime through arguments `pk_tbl_name` and `pk_col` in the `run_app()` function respectively.

For example, if you wanted to configure the app to use a table called `tblKEYS` with a primary key column `id` as the source of primary key information, you would run the app as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
run_app(pk_tbl_name = "tblKEYS", pk_col = "id")
```
